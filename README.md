# Optional-Exercise-04d-Enemies

Exercise for MSCH-C220

This exercise is designed to continue our creation of a 2D Platformer, by demonstrating some different types of enemies.

Fork this repository. When that process has completed, make sure that the top of the repository reads [your username]/Optional-Exercise-04d-Enemies. Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220-F22 with your full name. Commit your changes.

Clone the repository to a Local Path on your computer.

Open Godot. Navigate to this folder. Import the project.godot file and open the "Enemies" project.

Open `res://Game.tscn`. You will see a tilemap node laying out the level, and a second "Background" tilemap inside a Navigation2D node (setting out the navigable areas for the bat). Inside the Enemy_Container node, there are three different enemy types with distinct behaviors.

Test the game and see how the enemies behave. Would you make any changes or adjustments?

Quit Godot. In GitHub desktop, add a summary message, commit your changes and push them back to GitHub. If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your updated files with the time when they were changed.

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Optional-Exercise-04d-Enemies) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing the "Created by" information with your name):
